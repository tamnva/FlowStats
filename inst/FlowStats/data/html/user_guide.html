<p><b>Welcome!</b> 
<p>FlowStats is a tool for near real time (1 day delay) streamflow visualization for Germany based on DWD data and LSTM rainfall-runoff model.</p>
<p> The current color of the gauged is visualized based on the performance of the LSTM model for the test period (2010-2020) </p>
<p> Please following steps when using this app: <span style="color: blue;"> Update data (optional)</span>  <span>&#8594;</span>  <span style="color: blue;"> Single gauge </span> <span>&#8594;</span>  <span style="color: blue;"> All gauges</span>.</p>

 <ol>
  <li>Update data: This is optional, to get lastest data from DWD and run the LSTM model to have streamflow from yesterday. Otherwise the data is taken from the base data in this tool from 01.1980 - 5.2025 </li>
  <li>Single gauge: Visualize streamflow at an individual gauge—through time series, yearly cycle time series, or cumulative yearly cycle time series—by clicking the gauge location on the Leaflet map. </li>
  <li>All Gauges: Visualize statistical streamflow indices for all gauges (note: computationally intensive <span>&#8594;</span>) </li>
</ol>
