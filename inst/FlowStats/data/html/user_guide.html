<p><b>Welcome!</b> 
<p>FlowStats is a tool for near real time (1 day delay) streamflow visualization for Germany based on DWD data and LSTM rainfall-runoff model.</p>
<p> The current color of the gauged is visualized based on the performance of the LSTM model for the test period (2010-2020) </p>
<p> Please following steps when using this app: <span style="color: blue;"> Update data (optional)</span>  <span>&#8594;</span>  <span style="color: blue;"> Single gauge </span> <span>&#8594;</span>  <span style="color: blue;"> All gauges</span>.</p>

 <ol>
  <li>Update data: This is optional, to get lastest data from DWD and run the LSTM model to have streamflow from yesterday. Otherwise the data is taken from the base data in this tool from 01.1980 - 5.2025 </li>
  <li>Single gauge: Visualizing streamflow in single gauge by clicking to the gauge position in the leaflet map. The objective of this is to understand the index that user going to applied for all gauges or to understand streamflow in selected gauge</li>
  <li>All gauges: Here the applied index that is shown in the single gauged will be applied to all gauges (high computational demand <span>&#8594;</span>  response time could be slow) </li>
</ol>
