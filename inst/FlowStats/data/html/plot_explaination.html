<p>The data used to generate these plots are simulated outputs from an LSTM model at a daily time step, covering the period from January 1980 to yesterday (assuming the data has been updated). Below is an explanation of the different plot types:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Daily": Plots the daily streamflow (in cubic meters per second, cms) for the selected station you click on in the Leaflet map.</li>
<li>Plots the daily streamflow (cms) for the current year. Additionally, the daily range of streamflows from all previous years is shown using the following color scheme (<a href="https://waterwatch.usgs.gov/?id=ww_current">adapted from USGS WaterWatch</a>):
<ul>
<li><span style="background-color: #276419;">Above 90th percentile: Much above normal</span></li>
<li><span style="background-color: #9cce64;">75th - 90th percentile: Above normal</span></li>
<li><span style="background-color: #d0ebab;">25th - 75th percentiles: Normal</span></li>
<li><span style="background-color: #f1b6da;">10th - 25th percentile: Below normal</span></li>
<li><span style="background-color: #d01c8b;">Below 10th percentile: Much below normal</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"Daily cumsum (by year)": Plots the cumulative daily streamflow (cms) from the beginning of the calendar year for the current year. Additionally, the cumulative daily ranges of streamflow from all previous years are displayed using the same color scheme as in "Daily (by year).""</li>
